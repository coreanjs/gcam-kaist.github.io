## Core Model Proposal #359: Hydrogen and transportation technology update

### Transportation

-   Natural Gas Vehicles(NGV)
-   Light-duty vehicles
    -   지역별로 LDV의 사이즈를 4개씩 구분하였고, 각각의 배터리 용량(kwh poer vehicle) 제시
    -   BEV battery pack costs는 2020 BNEF EV Outlook에서 가져옴
    -   cost mark-up??
    -   Fuel cell stack costs는 [NREL, 2020 Transportation Annual Technology Baseline](https://atb.nrel.gov/transportation/2020/index)에서 가져옴

<br>

-   gcam-7의 transportation_UCD_CORE.xml과 비교해보니, supplysector, energy-final-demand의 구성 name은 동일함
-   The most common failure to run GCAM when double clicking the run-gcam executable script typically relate to Java.
-   model running 테스트 -\> `All model periods solved correctly.`

-   Model run 결과는 exe - log - main_log.txt 에서 확인 가능
-   output - queries
-   ModelInterface - run-model-interface.bat

## 2023-08-21 meeting with prof.Jeon

-   GCAM7에는 trn_freight_road(트럭)에 hybrid 추가됨. Dawoon 파일에는 hybrid 없음
-   Created new xml configuration by adding lines

::: callout-note
for `<Configuration>` `<Value name = "transport">../input/gcamdata/xml/transportation_UCD_SSP1.xml</Value>`
:::

::: callout-important
## 분석기간을 2100년이 아닌 2050년까지만 보고싶은데;;; 오류남.

for stop year `<Value name="stop-year">2050</Value>` -\> DOESN'T WORK!!!
:::

-   Saved as `configuration_transportation_SSP1.xml` for backup

-   Again, saved it as `configuration.xlm` cause `run-batct.cat` in exe folder take `configuration.xlm`(not configuration_transporation_SSP1.xml) as input file

-   run model ![model](./img/model_solved.png)

-   for checking model results, go to Modelinterface folder, and click `run-model-interface.bat` and File - Open -DB Open

![model run result](./img/model_interface_2.png)


* configuration.xml 파일에 `vale name = solver` 밑에 새로운 `value name = transport` 추가

### git bash or tortoiseGit?

* Instead of using `tortoiseGit`, I hope to use `git bash`. Running `tortoise git` takes quite a long time when targeted `.xml` files are heavy. For using, CLI(Command line interface) needs to be learned. But, steep learning curve :(

### git diff
Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc

* Tried to use `git diff` to see difference between versions in a file.
  1. moved `transportation_UCD_CORE.xml` into a test folder
  
  2. modified a  `speed` in 2020 from 450 to 500 for make a difference. and then saved it.
  
  
![](./img/diff_test.png)

  3. Result.  We can find a difference without add or commit. just typing `git diff` gives the difference.
  
![](./img/diff_test_result.png)
  
  4.Modified `speed` in 2030, 2035 and typed `git diff` again. Same as 2.
  
![](./img/git_diff_result2.png)  

  5. Commit `git commit` and track my log using `git log` 
  

![](./img/git_log.png)

  6. what's next?   reset? revert?
