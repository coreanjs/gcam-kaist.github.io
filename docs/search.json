He is currently on leave from the Joint Global Change Research Institute and the Center for Global Sustainability, where he played a pivotal role in developing decarbonization pathways with the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM). His research primarily focuses on the using Integrated Assessment Models (IAM) to formulate low-carbon, carbon-neutral, and carbon-negative pathways for mitigating climate change. While at KAIST Graduate School of Green Growth & Sustainability, he will be teaching the next generation of modelers on the application of quantitative models for evaluating decarbonization strategies in developing Asia.\nHaewon has served as the lead Integrated Assessment Modeler for two White House reports on deep decarbonization pathways (Long-Term Strategy, 2021 and Mid-Century Strategy, 2016). Furthermore, he served as the modeling lead for the America’s Pledge project. Throughout his career, he has maintained close collaboration with research clients from government agencies, foundations, and the private sector.\nHe has published widely encompassing topics such as the impact of fossil fuels on climate change, decarbonization technologies, and decision-making under uncertainties. He has published over 70 papers in peer-reviewed journals, including Nature, Science, Energy Economics, and Climatic Change.\nDr. McJeon holds a Ph.D. and a Master’s degree in Environmental Policy from the University of Maryland, as well as a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from Seoul National University."

    "title": "Global Stocktake: to limit global warming to 1.5°C, continued ratcheting of decarbonization is needed",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In a new commentary in One Earth, the international group of researchers from Korea, China, and the U.S. take stock of the current NDCs and assess the need to increase near-term decarbonization ambition to limit global warming to 1.5°C.\n\nKAIST Graduate School of Green Growth & Sustainability visiting professor Haewon McJeon stated that “while the NDCs submitted at COP26 in November 2021 collectively steered us toward limiting global temperature rise to under 2°C by the century’s end but fell short of the ambitious 1.5°C goal.”\nCOP28’s central focus is on the Global Stocktake (GST), designed to assess countries’ progress toward their NDCs and the Agreement’s long-term objectives. While evaluating progress remains key, the GST also aims to pinpoint priority areas for enhanced ambition to align with the Paris Agreement’s long-term goal of keeping global temperature increase below 1.5°C. Three critical policy areas stand out: non-CO2 gases, carbon dioxide removal (CDR), and deforestation. Decision-makers are urged to concentrate their efforts in these areas during COP28 and the GST to better align countries’ commitments with the Paris Agreement’s long-term climate objectives.\nThe initial NDCs submitted after the 2015 Paris Agreement fell short of the 2°C target, with a high risk of exceeding 3°C. COP26 showcased the Agreement’s ratcheting mechanism, resulting in updated NDCs and ambitious decarbonization pledges. If countries maintain a 2% decarbonization rate beyond 2030, there’s a >50% chance of limiting end-of-century warming to <2°C, rising to nearly 70% with a 5% rate. However, achieving the aspirational 1.5°C goal remains unlikely, necessitating further ambition. Even with enhanced ambition, global temperatures may temporarily exceed 1.5°C this century, making near-term collective ambition vital to limit temperature overshooting and incentivize R&D in technologies like carbon dioxide removal, accelerate fossil fuel phase-out, and engage the private sector for cost-effective long-term GHG reductions.\nKey gaps persist in climate policy despite progress. Addressing non-CO2 emissions, carbon dioxide removal (CDR), and halting deforestation is crucial. Reducing non-CO2 emissions by 2030 can help curb temperature rise and overshooting the 1.5°C threshold, impacting global temperature change. CDR, essential for achieving net-zero emissions, lacks detailed plans in many countries’ commitments. There’s a gap between proposed CDR levels and what’s needed for Paris goals, and current technologies are not ready or cost-effective. Incentivizing research and development in novel CDR methods is vital. Halting deforestation is paramount, as it contributes significantly to emissions, but despite commitments, deforestation continues, driven by commercial crop expansion. Closing these policy gaps is essential for effective climate action.\nAchieving deeper near-term reductions in non-CO2 emissions is feasible through various technological solutions, including end-of-pipe control measures and behavioral changes like dietary shifts. Some post-COP26 efforts, such as the United States Inflation Reduction Act and China’s policies addressing methane emissions, demonstrate increased ambition in this regard. However, global ambition in non-CO2 emission reductions should encompass a broader range of gases, account for emissions from all sectors, and prioritize R&D for long-term solutions. Additionally, scaling up carbon dioxide removal (CDR) measures is essential, requiring increased investment in a diverse portfolio of CDR technologies beyond current efforts. Effective emissions trading mechanisms for CDR necessitate robust accounting rules and monitoring frameworks, as well as consideration of synergies and tradeoffs with other sustainability priorities.\nImplications for Korea: Korea has set an ambitious goal to achieve carbon neutrality, but to contribute meaningfully to global collective action and achieve the 1.5°C goal, there is a need for strengthening near-term NDCs. Faster coal-fired powerplant retirement and rapid increase in clean power generation will be critical near-term steps."

Regional population and labor productivity growth assumptions drive the energy and land-use systems employing numerous technology options to produce, transform, and provide energy services as well as to produce agriculture and forest products, and to determine land use and land cover. Using a run period extending from 1990 – 2100 at 5 year intervals, GCAM has been used to explore the potential role of emerging energy supply technologies and the greenhouse gas consequences of specific policy measures or energy technology adoption including; CO2 capture and storage, bioenergy, hydrogen systems, nuclear energy, renewable energy technology, and energy use technology in buildings, industry and the transportation sectors. GCAM is an Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)-class model. This means it can be used to simulate scenarios, policies, and emission targets from various sources including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Output includes projections of future energy supply and demand and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions, radiative forcing and climate effects of 16 greenhouse gases, aerosols and short-lived species at 0.5×0.5 degree resolution, contingent on assumptions about future population, economy, technology, and climate mitigation policy."
